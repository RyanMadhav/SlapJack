                <h2>Overview</h2>
                Slapjack, also known as Slaps, is a simple standard-deck card game, generally played among children. It can often be a child's first introduction to playing cards.Slapjack, or Slaps, is a game for 2-4 people and played with a standard 52 playing card deck. The objective of Slapjack is to win all of the cards by quickly slapping the deck whenever a Jack is played. The first player to slap their hand down on the jack takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile.
